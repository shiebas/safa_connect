# 🎉 SAFA Merchandise Store - FIXED & READY! ✅

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Template Tag Error ✅
**Problem**: `'Product' object has no attribute 'encode'` error in template tags
**Solution**: Fixed the `placeholder_image` template filter to handle both Product objects and strings properly

### 2. Badge Positioning Issue ✅
**Problem**: Discount and "New" badges overlapping with product names
**Solution**: 
- Improved CSS positioning for product badges
- Added proper spacing between multiple badges
- Enhanced badge layout in both store home and product list templates

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Template Tag Fix
- Updated `merchandise_tags.py` to handle Product objects correctly
- The filter now checks if the input is a Product object or string
- Extracts product name properly for placeholder generation

### 2. Template Improvements
- Updated all templates to use consistent image loading logic
- Added proper fallback chain: `main_image` → `images.first` → `placeholder`
- Added `merchandise_tags` loading to all relevant templates

### 3. Badge Layout Enhancement
- Fixed CSS positioning for product badges
- Added proper spacing between discount and featured badges
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with improved badge placement
- Added background fallback for product images

### 4. Image Loading Chain
All product images now follow this priority:
1. **Main Image**: `product.main_image` (primary product image)
2. **Gallery Image**: `product.images.first` (first additional image)
3. **Placeholder**: Generated placeholder with product name and unique color
