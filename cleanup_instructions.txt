# Docker Cleanup Instructions

The following files and scripts are related to Docker and can be safely deleted if you no longer wish to use Docker for your project:

- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- entrypoint.sh
- wait-for-postgres.sh

You may also want to remove any Docker-related configuration from your VS Code settings or extensions.

## Steps to Remove Docker from Your Project

1. Delete the above files from your project directory.
2. Uninstall or disable any Docker-related VS Code extensions (such as the official Docker extension).
3. Remove any Docker-related environment variables or settings from your `.env` or configuration files if present.

After these steps, your project will no longer contain Docker-related files or configuration.
