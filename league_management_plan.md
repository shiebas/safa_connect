I've analyzed `league_management/models.py`. Here's what I found and my proposed plan:

**Current State:**
*   Models exist for `CompetitionCategory`, `Competition`, `CompetitionGroup`, `Team`, `CompetitionTeam`, and `Match`.
*   `PlayerStatistics` tracks player stats by `player_name` (a string), not a dedicated `Player` object. There's no explicit "squad" model.
*   The `Match` model is ready for fixtures, but there's no automated fixture generation logic.

**Proposed Plan:**

**Phase 1: Player and Squad Management**
1.  **Create `Player` Model:** A new model to represent individual players (e.g., `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`).
2.  **Update `PlayerStatistics`:** Modify it to link to the new `Player` model.
3.  **Create `SquadPlayer` Model:** A new model to link `Player` instances to `CompetitionTeam`s, defining a squad and including details like jersey number.
4.  **Update Admin Interface:** Make these new models manageable in the Django admin.

**Phase 2: Fixture Generation**
1.  **Create Management Command:** Develop a Django management command (e.g., `generate_fixtures`) that implements a round-robin algorithm.
2.  **Generate Matches:** This command will create `Match` objects for all teams in a given competition/group.

**Phase 3: Date Assignment**
1.  Initially, generated matches will have no specific dates.
2.  Dates and times can then be manually assigned to `Match` objects via the admin or a custom interface.

**Question for you:**
For the new `Player` model, should it link to an existing `accounts.models.CustomUser` (if players are also system users), or should it be a completely separate entity?
