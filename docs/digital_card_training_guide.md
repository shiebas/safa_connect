## Understanding Digital Cards

### What Are Digital Cards?

Digital cards are modern, electronic versions of traditional membership cards. They provide the same identification and verification functionality but with enhanced features like:

- Digital wallet integration
- Dynamic updating
- Interactive elements
- Enhanced security

### SAFA's Implementation

The SAFA Digital Card system transforms traditional membership identification into secure, modern digital cards that resemble banking cards. This implementation includes:

1. **Bank card-like design** with professional aesthetics
2. **16-digit card numbers** with Luhn algorithm validation
3. **QR codes** for quick verification
4. **Google Wallet integration** for mobile access
5. **Interactive elements** like card flip and 3D effects

### Benefits Over Traditional Cards

| Feature | Physical Cards | Digital Cards |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Cost | High (printing, distribution) | Low (one-time development) |
| Update Process | Reissue required | Instant updates |
| Security | Can be forged | Digital verification |
| Accessibility | Must be carried | Always on mobile device |
| Features | Static | Dynamic & interactive |
| Analytics | Limited tracking | Comprehensive usage data |

## The Luhn Algorithm Explained

### What Is the Luhn Algorithm?

The Luhn algorithm (also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm) is a simple checksum formula used to validate identification numbers like credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and now SAFA's digital cards.

### How It Works

1. **Starting from the rightmost digit** (excluding the check digit), double the value of every second digit.
2. **If doubling results in a two-digit number**, subtract 9 from it.
3. **Sum all digits** (including the check digit).
4. **If the total is divisible by 10**, the number is valid.

### Visual Example

For the partial card number: `2 2025 12345 678` (without check digit):

1. Double alternate digits (from right): `2 4 0 2 1 6 3 8 5 14 7 16`
2. Subtract 9 if needed: `2 4 0 2 1 6 3 8 5 5 7 7`
3. Sum all digits: `2+4+0+2+1+6+3+8+5+5+7+7 = 50`
4. Calculate check digit: `(10 - (50 % 10)) % 10 = 0`
5. Final card number: `2 2025 12345 6780`

### Why We Use It

1. **Error Detection**: Catches accidental errors in card numbers
2. **Security**: Makes it harder to generate valid card numbers randomly
3. **Industry Standard**: Used by major credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard
4. **Professional Implementation**: Adds legitimacy to our digital cards

### Implementation Details

The algorithm is implemented in the `DigitalCard` model's methods:
- `generate_luhn_check_digit()`: Calculates the check digit
- `verify_luhn_algorithm()`: Validates complete card numbers
- `generate_card_number()`: Creates new card numbers with valid check digits

## Google Wallet Integration

### What is Google Wallet?

Google Wallet (formerly Google Pay) is Google's digital wallet platform that allows users to store various items like payment cards, loyalty cards, and tickets on their Android devices. Our integration lets members store their SAFA membership cards in Google Wallet for convenient access.

### How the Integration Works

![Google Wallet Integration Diagram](https://example.com/wallet_diagram.jpg)

1. **Pass Creation**: We define a pass template for how membership cards appear
2. **JWT Generation**: A secure token is created with member details
3. **Member Action**: Member clicks "Add to Google Wallet" button
4. **Google Processing**: Google processes the JWT and creates a pass
5. **Mobile Access**: Member can access their card in Google Wallet app

### Required Components

1. **Google Cloud Account**: Project with Google Wallet API enabled
2. **Service Account**: With Wallet Object Issuer permission
3. **Issuer ID**: Unique identifier for SAFA as a pass issuer
4. **Class Definition**: Template for all SAFA membership cards
5. **Object Definition**: Individual member's card data

### Benefits for Members

- **Convenience**: Quick access to membership card without opening SAFA app
- **Offline Access**: Card available without internet connection
- **Automatic Updates**: Card data updates automatically
- **Notifications**: Location-based reminders (e.g., at stadiums)

### Administrative View

As an administrator, you can:
- Monitor wallet pass usage through Google Cloud dashboard
- View aggregated statistics on pass additions
- Track updates and synchronization status
- Manage card template and branding

### Technical Requirements

For test and development:
- Any Google test issuer ID works
- Test service account credentials

For production:
- Verified issuer ID from Google
- Production service account with proper restrictions
- Secure key storage (credentials directory)

## Training Exercises

### Exercise 1: Card Validation

**Objective:** Understand how to check card number validity.

1. Go to Card Dashboard > Card Validation Tool
2. Enter these sample numbers and determine validity:
   - `2202512345678X` (replace X with correct check digit)
   - `2202598765432X` (replace X with correct check digit)
3. Create an invalid number by changing one digit, verify it fails validation

### Exercise 2: Card Lifecycle Management

**Objective:** Practice managing card status changes.

1. Create a test card for a fictional member
2. Follow procedures to:
   - Suspend the card (e.g., for payment issues)
   - Reactivate the card (e.g., after payment)
   - Mark as expired (e.g., membership ended)
   - Revoke the card (e.g., disciplinary action)

### Exercise 3: Google Wallet Integration

**Objective:** Experience the member's Google Wallet flow.

1. Use test credentials to enable Google Wallet
2. Generate a test card and add it to your own Google Wallet
3. Verify the card appears correctly
4. Update card information and check synchronization

### Exercise 4: Troubleshooting Scenario

**Objective:** Practice resolving common support issues.

Scenario: "A member reports their QR code is not scanning at events."

1. Identify potential causes (poor image quality, outdated version, etc.)
2. Follow diagnostic procedures
3. Implement appropriate fix
4. Verify solution

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Why did we switch to a bank card-like design?**
A: The bank card design provides a professional, premium feel that members associate with security and value. It also allows us to implement banking-standard security features like the Luhn algorithm.

**Q: What is the difference between revoking and suspending a card?**
A: Suspending is temporary (e.g., pending payment) with the expectation of reactivation. Revoking is permanent (e.g., disciplinary action) and requires issuing a new card if the member is reinstated.

**Q: How often are cards renewed?**
A: Cards are renewed automatically when the associated membership is renewed. Expiry dates are synchronized with membership dates.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What is the card number format?**
A: Our card numbers follow this format: `2 YYYY NNNNNNNNN C` where:
- `2` is the SAFA prefix
- `YYYY` is the issuance year
- `NNNNNNNNN` is a random 9-digit sequence
- `C` is the Luhn check digit

**Q: How secure are the QR codes?**
A: QR codes contain digitally signed data using Django's signing module. This prevents tampering and ensures authenticity. Each QR code also has a version number that can be incremented to invalidate old versions.

**Q: Can digital cards work offline?**
A: Yes, once added to Google Wallet, cards can be accessed without internet connectivity. Verification, however, requires an internet connection to validate against our database.

### Google Wallet Questions

**Q: Which devices support Google Wallet?**
A: Google Wallet is supported on most Android devices running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher. It's not currently available for iOS devices.

**Q: Do cards in Google Wallet update automatically?**
A: Yes, when changes are made to a member's card (e.g., status change), the Google Wallet version will update automatically when the device has internet connectivity.

**Q: Is there an Apple Wallet version?**
A: Apple Wallet integration is planned for future development. Currently, only Google Wallet is supported. We have comprehensive implementation plans and documentation ready for when this feature is approved. The implementation will require an Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) and additional development resources.
