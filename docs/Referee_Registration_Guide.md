## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

   - For non-South African referees, select "Passport" as the document type and enter the passport number
   - The system will automatically show/hide the appropriate field based on your document type selection

3. **Missing Association Information**:
   - Ensure your administrator account is properly linked to the correct organization
   - Contact system support if your organization is not appearing correctly

4. **File Upload Issues**:
