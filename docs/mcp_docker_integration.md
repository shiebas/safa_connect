# MCP & Docker Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to make the project MCP-compliant and Dockerized, following best practices for maintainability and future integrations.

---

## 1. Dockerization
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Python/Django environment and dependencies.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates Django and PostgreSQL containers for local development.
- **.env**: Store environment variables (not committed to git).

### Usage
- Build: `docker-compose build`
- Run: `docker-compose up`
- Stop: `docker-compose down`

---

## 2. MCP Compliance
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Standardizes API structure for interoperability.
- Add new DRF serializers and endpoints under `/api/mcp/`.
- Gradually migrate clients to use MCP endpoints.
- Maintain legacy endpoints for backward compatibility during transition.

---

## 3. Best Practices
- Incremental, non-breaking changes.
- Automated tests for all new endpoints.
- Document all changes and keep this file updated.

---

## 4. Future Integrations
- Payment gateways, mobile apps, and third-party services can easily integrate via MCP-compliant APIs.
